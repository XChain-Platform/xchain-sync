// newest row for a key with no as-of-height filter, so computing a
// historical block's root while later rows exist would read the future. The
// balances path (getNetBalance sums all credits/debits) has the identical
// property, and every caller of both satisfies it because roots are computed
// once, inside the block that produces them.

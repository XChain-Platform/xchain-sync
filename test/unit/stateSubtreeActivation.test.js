 * Reserved state_root sub-tree gate conformance, for SPV light
 * clients.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion here is the INERTNESS one: the three-argument
 * assembleStateRoot must produce a state_root byte-identical to the old
 * two-argument form on every chain, or landing this carrier silently forks every
 * deployed light client. That is asserted from both ends: the gate answers "off"
 * everywhere, and the assembler treats null / absent / empty-root slots as the
 * same EMPTY_SMT_ROOT leaf.
 *
 * The second job is proving the plumbing is NOT a permanent no-op: a populated
 * reserved slot must change state_root, each slot must occupy its own leaf
 * position, and arming a height in a scratch copy of the map must actually let a
 * sub-root through. A gate that can never open would pass every inertness test.
 *
 * TWIN PAIR: this ENTRY file and xchain-sync/test/unit/stateSubtreeActivation.test.js
 * are kept BYTE-IDENTICAL apart from the src/<feature>/ depth of their requires (the
 * gate and assembler they cover are themselves byte-identical twins). Locked equal by
 * the cross-repo twin loop in xchain-sync/test/unit/rollback-coverage.test.js. The
 * suite outgrew the file-length limit, so the map, gateSubRoots and assembler blocks
 * now sit beside it in state_subtree_activation.test/. That parts directory is NOT in
 * the twin registry, so a change there reaches the sync half only by hand or
 * reconcile-twins.sh.

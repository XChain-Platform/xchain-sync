 *
 * PersistentSMT node writes are BATCHED, and the batching changes
 * nothing but the statement count.
 *
 * The defect this pins was a throughput one with a correctness-shaped symptom.
 * One key update writes SMT_DEPTH internal nodes, and a value leaf's ancestors
 * are never an all-empty subtree, so the write loop is always a full 256 rows.
 * Issued one statement at a time that is 256 sequential DB round trips per key.
 * On the BTC regtest venue the stakes subtree is rebuilt from an empty root
 * EVERY block over 49 stake keys, which is 12,544 round trips and 25-66s of wall
 * clock per block, against LTC's 3-5s for the same code (LTC commits the empty
 * stakes root, so it never pays it). Five standing envelope tests failed as
 * timeouts and read as correctness failures.
 *
 * Two properties, and the second is the one with teeth:
 *   1. EQUIVALENCE - the batched engine emits the identical root and the
 *      identical node set as a per-node writer. This is the consensus guard.
 *   2. ROUND-TRIP COUNT - a key update costs a BOUNDED number of store writes,
 *      not one per level. Restoring the per-node loop reddens this and only
 *      this, which is what makes it a regression gate rather than a restatement
 *      of the conformance suite. The existing golden/fuzz tests all pass
 *      against the slow engine, which is exactly why they never caught it.
 *
 * No DB required: the counting store implements the same interface as
 * DbNodeStore. The DB-shaped half (chunking, SQL arity) is asserted against a
 * recording fake of doQueryStrict rather than a live MariaDB.

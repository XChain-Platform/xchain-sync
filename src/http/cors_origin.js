/**
 * Parse the CORS_ORIGIN env var into a value the `cors` package matches per-origin.
 *
 * The reason this exists rather than passing the raw string through: `cors`
 * treats a String origin as ONE exact origin and echoes it back verbatim to
 * every caller. So `CORS_ORIGIN="a,b"` emits `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: a,b`
 * to a, to b, and to a hostile origin alike - a multi-value header no browser
 * accepts, which blocks all of them while a header dump reads as configured.
 * sync.xchain.io is read cross-origin by more than one browser surface, so an
 * allowlist is the real shape of the setting and a single string never was.
 *
 * Fails CLOSED on anything ambiguous: an empty or all-blank value disables CORS
 * exactly as an unset var does, and `*` only means "any origin" when it is the
 * entire value. Mixed in with real origins it stays a literal list entry, which
 * no browser sends, so a fat-fingered `*,https://x` grants x and nothing more
 * rather than silently opening the service to everyone.
 *
 * Unlike the sibling services this is applied in src/config.js rather than at the
 * cors() call, because sync resolves every setting into `cfg` first and api.js
 * reads cfg['CORS_ORIGIN']. Parsing at the config seam is what keeps the raw env
 * string from reaching `cors` at all.
 *
 * Identical by intent to xchain-encoder/src/corsOrigin.js, xchain-hub's
 * src/lib/corsOrigin.js, xchain-indexer/src/corsOrigin.js,
 * xchain-utxo-tracker/src/corsOrigin.js and xchain-sdk/src/corsOrigin.js; keep
 * the six in step .
 *
 * @param {string|undefined|null} raw - the raw CORS_ORIGIN value
 * @returns {false|string|string[]} `false` (disabled), `'*'` (any), one origin, or an allowlist

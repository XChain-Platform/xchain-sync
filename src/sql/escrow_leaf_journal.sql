-- Touched set for one block (SPV sub-tree spec §3 Stage B):
--   SELECT DISTINCT address_id, tick_id FROM escrow_leaf_journal WHERE block_index = ?
CREATE INDEX idx_block  ON escrow_leaf_journal (block_index);
-- Latest value per key, and the as-of-height read that serves proofs:
--   SELECT locked_amount ... WHERE address_id=? AND tick_id=? [AND block_index<=?] ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1
CREATE INDEX idx_latest ON escrow_leaf_journal (address_id, tick_id, id DESC);

-- WHY THIS TABLE EXISTS (SPV sub-tree spec §3 Stage B).
--
-- The `escrows` ledger cannot answer "how much does this address have locked".
-- It is a per-tick CONSERVATION ledger, not a per-address lock ledger: of the 26
-- escrow write sites, four are locks keyed to the locker's SOURCE and 22 are
-- releases, NINE of which key to whoever RECEIVES the funds (order/swap matches
-- key to GET_ADDRESS, dispense and dispenser-close to DESTINATION, cross-settle
-- to payoutAddr). So SUM(escrows) per (address, tick) leaves the locker's key
-- stale-positive and drives the recipient's negative, and only the per-tick
-- global sum nets to zero (2026-06-18 finding).
--
-- Recomputing each locker's open remaining at read time is worse than it looks:
-- GIVE_REMAINING IS NOT A STORED COLUMN in ANY family. It is recomputed by
-- db.getOrderAmountsRemaining and db.getDispenserAmountRemaining (the latter
-- folding dispenser EDITs), so "reconstruct as of height H" would put a SECOND
-- implementation of four families' remaining logic inside a consensus surface,
-- which is the shape that forks.
--
-- So the source computes each key's locked total ONCE, while processing the
-- block that changes it, and appends it here, shaped exactly like
-- `contract_state` because Stage A already depends on those properties:
-- append-only + block_index + idx_block makes the touched set one indexed query
-- with one answer on both twins; rollback:'block' means a reorg deletes rows at
-- or above the orphan height and the next block threads from the surviving root,
-- so there is no repair pass to get wrong; the latest row at or below H serves
-- as-of-height proof reads that mutable order rows could not; and a NULL
-- locked_amount is the delete-on-zero tombstone, identical in meaning to a NULL
-- contract_state value.
--
-- REPLICATED, NOT RECOMPUTED (replication 'stream:block'): xchain-sync mirrors
-- these rows rather than deriving them, which is what keeps four families'
-- remaining logic from existing twice. The follower still recomputes the ROOT
-- from the replicated rows and halts on divergence, as it does for contract state.
--
-- NOT A COMMITMENT. Nothing here enters a hash until the escrow leaf is armed
-- (ESCROW_LOCKED_LEAF_ACTIVATION), so it can be populated below an armed height
-- with no consensus effect. That is also why Stage B needs no shadow column: the
-- journal IS its own shadow window.

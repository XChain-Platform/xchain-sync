 * Deployed-process armed-map fingerprint.
 *
 * Services install from release tarballs with no .git and stale package
 * versions, so nothing a process reports says WHICH consensus-gate build it
 * actually runs. Before a flag-day height the operator must confirm every
 * deployed process carries the same armed map or a straggler forks or halts at
 * the boundary (this exact mode halted LTC:testnet at 4805000 on 2026-07-10).
 * Hashing the byte content of the running build's gate files, and exposing that
 * on the health endpoint, lets a fleet sweep compare one string per process
 * instead of copying files out of containers.
 *
 * Per-file sha256 hashes are exposed too, because gate files that are twins
 * across repos can then be cross-compared service-to-service, while the
 * combined fingerprint only compares like-for-like processes of the SAME
 * service. This module is itself a twin in xchain-indexer (FIXED_GATE_FILES
 * simply matches whichever carriers exist in each repo's src/); keep them in step.

// The gate set is a naming convention PLUS an explicit list, and the list is
// the part that carries the weight. The convention is every *_activation.js in
// this directory, enumerated at call time so a new per-gate arming twin joins
// the set the moment it lands. That alone is not the invariant it reads as:
// several of the highest-consequence armed maps in the tree live in files the
// convention does not match (EQUIV_HEADER_ACTIVATION in equivocation_header.js,
// STAKE_WEIGHTED_QUORUM_ACTIVATION in stake_weighted_quorum.js,
// MIN_STAKE_ACTIVATIONS in capability_min_stake_history.js,
// SNAPSHOT_BURIAL_ACTIVATION in snapshot_reorg_buffer.js), and two more sit one
// directory down where a flat listing cannot see them at all. A process running
// a stale copy of any of those published a fingerprint byte-identical to a
// correctly-armed peer, which is exactly the straggler this module exists to
// expose.
//
// Entries are posix-separated paths relative to this directory; a top-level
// carrier keeps its bare filename as its key, so per-file cross-service
// comparisons of the existing entries are unchanged. ONE list serves both
// repos: an entry naming a carrier this repo does not have drops out of its
// set, which is what lets the two copies stay byte-identical twins. Nothing
// here is self-policing, so the enforcement is a test, not this comment:
// test/unit/armedMapFingerprint.test.js scans src/ for activation-map
// DECLARATIONS and fails on any carrier the set does not cover.

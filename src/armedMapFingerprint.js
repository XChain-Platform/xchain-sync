 * Deployed-process armed-map fingerprint .
 *
 * Services install from release tarballs with no .git and stale package
 * versions, so nothing a process reports says WHICH consensus-gate build it
 * actually runs; before a flag-day height the operator must confirm every
 * deployed process carries the same armed map or a straggler forks/halts at
 * the boundary (this exact mode halted LTC:testnet at 4805000 on 2026-07-10).
 * This module hashes the byte content of the consensus-gate source files in
 * the RUNNING build - the same byte-identity standard the twin-parity CI
 * gates use - and the health endpoint exposes it, so a fleet sweep can
 * compare one string per process instead of docker-cp'ing files around
 * (bin/check-flagday-deploy.sh remains the deep/manual variant).
 *
 * Exposes per-file sha256 hashes too: gate files that are byte-identical
 * twins across repos (stateHash.js and the *_activation.js set exist in both
 * xchain-indexer and xchain-sync) can be cross-compared service-to-service,
 * while the combined fingerprint compares like-for-like processes of the
 * SAME service. This module is itself a byte-identical twin in both repos
 * (the FIXED_GATE_FILES filter simply matches whichever carriers exist in
 * each repo's src/); keep the two copies in sync.

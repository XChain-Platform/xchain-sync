 *
 * Light-client checkpoint-commitment flag-day (SPV spec §6.1/§6.3, Phase 2).
 *
 * Gates when the quorum-signed checkpoint canonical (and the on-chain ANCHOR)
 * begin COMMITTING the additive `state_root` + `block_merkle_root` (with their
 * version bytes) that the Phase 1 STATE_COMMITMENT flag-day made the indexer
 * compute. At/above this height the checkpoint signing string gains
 * `|STATE_ROOT|STATE_ROOT_VERSION|BLOCK_MERKLE_ROOT|BLOCK_MERKLE_VERSION` and a
 * new ANCHOR v3 carries the roots on DOGE; below it both keep their old shape and
 * the roots are absent. Because it changes the SIGNED preimage of every checkpoint
 * signature it is consensus-relevant and must deploy hub + ALL indexers + the
 * SDK/explorer verifiers atomically.
 *
 * UNLIKE the Phase 1 state_commitment_activation (which gates on each chain's OWN
 * local block_index), this gates on the BTC-anchored `snapshot_block` carried by
 * every checkpoint canonical, exactly like stake_weighted_quorum / equivocation_
 * header, so the hub and the BTC/LTC/DOGE indexers all flip the SIGNED shape on the
 * same anchor.
 *
 * LOCAL COPY of the canonical map in xchain-documentation/protocol/constants.js,
 * kept byte-equal by the cross-service regression suite (a divergence forks the
 * signed checkpoint and breaks federation quorum verification). Byte-identical twins
 * live in xchain-{hub,indexer,sdk,explorer}/src/checkpoint_commitment_activation.js.

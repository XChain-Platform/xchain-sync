 * The one regtest arming grammar, applied by the registry when a row is read.
 *
 * Five gate rows (ROLLCALL, ROLLCALL gates, the two mirror-admission heights
 * and the anchor-attest barrier) let a regtest venue arm their regtest entry
 * from an environment variable instead of a committed height: that is how one
 * venue carries an armed and an inert indexer and shows them binding the same
 * row at different blocks. Their modules keep their own resolver functions
 * (the exported ones tests drive), but the VALUE a running process applies is
 * the registry row, so the environment is parsed here, by the same grammar
 * every one of those resolvers uses, each time shared_rows.js arms a row for
 * a reader (cached per value, so a refused value is reported once).
 *
 * UNSET SHIPS INERT. Arming a network commits every BTC indexer on it to a
 * wired DOGE peer, so a venue opts in; a BTC-only venue that cannot answer a
 * roll-call close is left alone.
 *

 * The regtest arming height named by `raw`, the value of one env variable.
 *
 * Accepted forms, case-insensitive and trimmed:
 *   armed | genesis | on | true | yes  -> armedHeight
 *   a non-negative integer             -> that height, for a venue whose epochs
 *                                         should begin above an indexed prefix
 *   unset | '' | off | inert | false | no | none -> null (INERT)
 * Anything else fails CLOSED to null and says so on stderr as a process
 * warning (the registry depends on no logger), because a typo that silently
 * armed a venue would produce closes nobody meant to drive.
 *
 * @param {string|undefined} raw   the env variable's value
 * @param {number} armedHeight     the height the armed form resolves to
 * @param {string} label           the family named on stderr for a refused value
 * @param {string} envName         the env variable named on stderr
